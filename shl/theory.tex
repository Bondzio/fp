\subsection{Short introduction to nuclear and particle physics}
In order to understand the notions of half life period and nuclear fission we
give a short introduction into nuclear and particle physics following \cite{Hooshyar}.
In the following, let $Z$ be the atomic number, $N$ the number of neutrons and $A$ the number of nuclei, also
called nucleon number. Thus, $A = Z + N$. The electric charge of the nucleus in the ground state is $+Z e$.
It is common to describe the so called \emph{nuclides} with $_{Z}^{A}\textrm{Y}$.\\
The forces binding the nuclei contribute to the total mass of an atom in terms of the 
binding energy $\Delta E = \Delta M c^2$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta M = M_{tot.} - Z(M_p + M_e) - N M_n \, .
\end{equation}
We used the proton, electron and neutron masses $M_p$, $M_e$ and $M_n$ 
(see figure~\ref{fig:bindingenergy}).
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/bindingenergy}
    \caption{Binding energies for nuclei that are stable or long-lived \cite{Hooshyar}.}
    \label{fig:bindingenergy}
\end{figure}
If we look at the distribution of stable nuclei (see figure~\ref{fig:nuclidmap}) we notice
that they occur only in a very narrow band. All other nuclei are unstable and decay spontaneously.
The decay is characerized by a \emph{decay constant} $\lambda$, which is related to the activity $\mathcal{A}$
by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decay}
    \mathcal{A} = -\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} = \lambda N 
\end{equation}
where the activity $\mathcal{A}$ is typically given in Bequerel: $1 \textrm{Bq}= \textrm{decay}\cdot s^{-1}$.
A solution to the differential equation \eqref{eq:decay} is
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A}(t) = \lambda N_0 \exp(-\lambda t) \, ,
\end{equation}
with the initial condition $N_0 := N(t=t_0)$. 
The probability of an atom to decay within time $t$ is thus
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(t) = \int_{0}^{t}\lambda \exp(-\lambda t')\mathrm{d}t' = 1 -  \exp(-\lambda t)  \quad
    \textrm{with} \quad \int_{0}^{\infty}\lambda \exp(-\lambda t')\mathrm{d}t' = 1 \, .
\end{equation}
The probability density is accordingly $f(t) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda t)$. 
Hence, we can calculate the expectation value of a random variable $t$ within the probability space
$\Omega$ with the measure  $\mathcal{P}$:
\begin{equation}
    \tau := E[t] = \int_{0}^{\infty} t \lambda \exp(-\lambda t) \mathrm{d}t 
    =\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \frac{exp(-\lambda t) (1-\lambda t) - 1 }{\lambda} \right] 
= \frac{1}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
The half-life $t_{1/2}$ is obviously connected by $t_{1/2}= -\mathrm{log}(2)/ \lambda = - \tau \mathrm{log}(2)$.

        Here we chose as the decay of
        $^{57}\textrm{Cs}\rightarrow ^{57}\textrm{Fe}$ with $t_{1/2}=270$ over a range
    of 4 years as an example.}

\subsubsection{Semi-Empirical Mass Formula: The liquid drop model}
\begin{figure}[htpb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/nuclidmap}
    \caption{Nuclid map of stable nuclei \cite{Hooshyar}: The squares are the long-lived nuclei
    occuring in nature; other known nuclei lie within the jagged lines and are unstable.}
    \label{fig:nuclidmap}
\end{figure}
\label{ssub:Semi-Empirical Mass Formula: The Liquid Drop Model}
Going along with  \cite{Hooshyar}, we approach an theoretic model containing constants which
have to be fitted with experiments. For this reason, the model is called semi-empirical. 
It was first established by Weizs√§cker and yields a 
good approximation for the atomic masses. The assumptions underlying are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The interior mass densities are approximately equal; +++OF WHAT???
        \label{it1}
    \item Their total binding energies are approximately proportional to their masses.
        \label{it2}
\end{enumerate}
Both turnout to be valid in the regime we are looking at.
The assumptions show why the model is called \emph{liquid drop model}: (\ref{it1}) relates to the equality of densities
of drops and (\ref{it2}) to the proportionality of latent heats of vaporization to the masses of a drops. 
We construct the energy in units of masses with different contributions:
\begin{equation}
    M_{tot} = \sum_{i=0}^{5} f_i 
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mass term:} 
First we take into account the atomic masses 
consisting of the mass of the nucleons and electrons:
\begin{equation}
    f_0 = Z(M_p + m_e) + (A-Z)M_n
\end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Volume term:} This term will estimate the effect of strong 
        nuclear forces proportional to the volume:
        \begin{equation}
            f_1 = -a_1 A\, ,
        \end{equation}
        where $a_1$ has to be found depending on the volume. 
    \item \textbf{Surface term:} 
        This term corrects the volume energy by a surface term
        \begin{equation}
            f_2 = a_2 A^{\frac{2}{3}} 
        \end{equation}
        taking into account that in binding energy is lowered as nuclei at the surface 
        have fewer interaction partners. The analogue is the surface tension energy 
        in the classical liquid drop model.
    \item \textbf{Coulomb term:} The protons of each nucleus repell each other due to the 
        electrostatic Coulomb force.If we assume a uniform charge distribution of 
        radius proportional to $A^{\frac{1}{3}}$, then
        \begin{equation}
            f_3 = a_3 \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{\frac{1}{3}}} \approx a_3 \frac{Z^2}{A^{\frac{1}{3}}} 
            \qquad (\text{for} \quad Z \gg 1)
        \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Assymetric term:} Due to the Pauli principle the nuclei tend to broaden their distribution
        on energies, with leads to a positive energy correction for more assymetric numbers $A$ and $Z$:
        \begin{equation}
            f_4 = a_4 \frac{(Z- \frac{A}{2})^2}{A}
        \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Pairing term:} This correction accounts for the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs
        to occur, where an even number of particles is more stable than an odd number:
      \begin{equation}
          f_5   =
          \begin{cases}
              -f(A) & \text{if $Z$ even and $A-Z=N$ even}\\
              0     & \text{if $Z$ even but $A-Z=N$ odd or $Z$ odd but $A-Z=N$ even}\\
              f(A)  & \text{if $Z$ odd and $A-Z=N$ odd}
          \end{cases}
          \label{eq:pair}
      \end{equation}
      The function $f(A)$ should be estimated by fitting the data, 
      often $f(A) = a_5 A^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is used.
\end{itemize}
+++SUMMARY???

\subsubsection{Unstable States}
\label{ssub:Unstable States}
If we want investigate the form of the energy distribution of a decay, we have to 
introduce the \emph{natural decay width}, given by
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_f = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_f} 
\end{equation}
which can be defined for each channel $f$, such that in total we get
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma = \sum_{f} \Gamma_f \, .
\end{equation}
+++WHY SUMMING???
We can define the \emph{branching ratio} for channel $f$ by
\begin{equation}
    B_f = \frac{\Gamma_f}{\Gamma} \, .
\end{equation}
The energy distribution of the unstable state to a final state $f$ resolves into a 
\emph{Breit-Wigner-distribution}: +++WHAT IS MEANT???
\begin{equation}
    N_f(M_f) = \frac{\Gamma_f}{(M_f-M_i)^2 c^4 + \Gamma^2/4}
\end{equation}
with the mass of the decaying state $M_i$ and the invariant mass of decay products $M_f$.

    $\Gamma_f = \hbar / \textrm{log}(2)t_{1/2} = 122$keV, which resamples in the width of the curve.}
