\section{Setup and procedure}
First we give an overview of the program which constitutes the experiment. In another subsection, 
we give a describtion of the setup used. 
\subsection{Procedure}
The procedure of measurements consists of the following six points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        \textbf{Assessing the detectors and probe at hand with the oscilloscope:}
        We measure the signals of the preamplifier (PA) as wel as uni- and bipolar outputs of 
        main amplifier (MA) at the oscilloscope. With this signal, we calculate the ascending time 
        of the signal.
    \item 
        \textbf{recording the energy spectrum of $^{57}$Co and $^{241}$Am:}
        The multichannel analyzer (MA)
        
    \item
        \textbf{setting the energy windows:}
    \item
        \textbf{measuring the delayed coincidences:}
    \item
        \textbf{measuring the background (random coincidences):}
    \item
        \textbf{time calibration of Time to Amplitude converter (TAC):}
\end{enumerate}
