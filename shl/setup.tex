\section{Setup and procedure}
First we give an overview of the program which constitutes the experiment. In another subsection, 
we give a describtion of the setup used. 
\subsection{Procedure}
The procedure of measurements consists of the following six points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        \textbf{assessing the detectors and probe at hand with the oscilloscope}:
    \item 
        \textbf{recording the energy spectrum of $^{57}$Co and $^{241}$Am with the multichannel analyzer (MA)}:
    \item
        \textbf{setting the energy windows}:
    \item
        \textbf{measuring the delayed coincidences}:
    \item
        \textbf{measuring the background (random coincidences)}:
    \item
        \textbf{time calibration of Time to Amplitude converter (TAC)}:
\end{enumerate}
