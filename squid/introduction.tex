\section{Introduction}
In this experiment we are in the fortunate position of having the 
possibility to exploit the fascinating phenomena of superconductivity for
our purposes -- fascinating both theoretically and experimentally. We will
estimate the magnetic field and the dipole moment of specific conduction loop,
but various other materials as well. In the end we can even make assumptions
about the spatial spread of the magnetic fields of the samples.
\paragraph{The Superconducter} 
was discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, while
investigating the temperature dependence of electrical resistance.
He noticed the disappereance of resistance of mercury below 4.2 K and
after this discovery more materials were found to have this
superconducting property. We will talk about these properties and the
physical intuition behind in the following, section~\ref{sec:theory}.
Part of the scope is 
to get an understanding of superconductivity in general, since we use it
extensively in our experimental setup, the SQUID 
(see section~\ref{sec:technics} for an comprehensive introduction).
