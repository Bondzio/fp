\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Identification and enumeration of progressions}
To be able to identify the absorbtion spectrum of the iodine 2 molecule, we have to analise 
the measurements for callibration with the Na- and Hg-vapour lamps, respectively. Both 
measurements are plotted in figures \rev{fig:Na1}
The measured spectrum is shown in figure \rev{fig:spectrum1}. One can clearly see the 
absorbtion peaks
