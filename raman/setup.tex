\section{Setup}
The experiment is conducted in a closed box containing the beam path and both measurement devices, a monochromator and a 
CCD spectrometer, attached. Further devices for amplification of the monochromator's signal as well as sources for the 
laser current and the photomultiplier voltage are arranged on a rack. The beam path consists of a laser, a sample at which
the photons are scattered, optical lenses for focusing and one of the two spectrometers. Further included for various 
measurements are the following devices:
