3. Underground measurement with covered sample. \\
4. Measuring spectra of the lamp used with both lattices. \\
5. Determining the bandgap energy of Si and Ge using their absorption and transmission spectra. \\
\section{Haynes-Shockley-experiment} 
1. Observation and measurement of a cloud of charged carriers'(created in p-type Ge using a laser pulse) development in time and space. \\
2. Determining the mean lifetime of the free electrons using the time development of the signal amplitude. \\
3. Determining the mobility of the free electrons using the time development of the center of the signal. \\
4. Determining the diffusion constant using the time development of the signal's shape.\\
\section{Semiconductor detectors} 
1. Measuring the spectra of Co-57 and Am-241 with a CdTe- and a Si-detector respectively. \\
2. Underground measurement of both the CdTe- and the Si-detector. \\
3. Determining the relation of absorption probabilities of the two detectors using the relation of their peak heights (at the same energy). \\
4. Determining the relative energy resolution using position and width of the peaks.
