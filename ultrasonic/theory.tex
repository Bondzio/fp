\section{Theory}
\subsection{Diffraction}
\subsubsection{Principle of Huygens-Fresnel} 
We will develop the theory of diffraction \cite{landau2} which will be useful in the further progress
the theory. When start from geometrical optics, we notice that we use the approximation for the 
wavelength to be infinitely small. Taking into account the finite value of wavelength, we arrive at the
main concept of diffraction phenomena. Let's assume for an instance that the path of the light is limited by
opaque objects like an opening smaller than the beam of the light - then geometrical optics would predict 
total separation between shadow and light after the opening. But with finite wavelengths, this separation
is nullified by a complicated geometric intensity distribution fringing the areas of light,
depending on the shape and size of the opening. Clearly the smaller the openings are compared to the
wavelength this effects become stronger and stronger.
\begin{figure}[htpb]

    \caption{Sketch for the calculation of the intensity distribution Later. the Point $P$ denotes a distant
        point where we want to propagate the wave to, while $df$ at the surface of the aperture. For now 
        we assume the light incoming from the left side is parallel and monochromatic.}
    \label{fig:beam}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Frauenhofer Diffraction} 
We will not look at the non-dynamic case, leaving out all the factors $e^{-i\omega t}$ which can be appended
easily if necessary. We start with a general wave incident from the left side, with value $g(f)$ at the
surface of the aperture at a point $f$ (see figure \ref{fig:beam}). Then the wave at point $P$ due to the
out coming wave of $f$ will
be proportional to $g(f)$. The energy density is reduced due to the enlarged surface proportional to $R$ 
and gaining a phase $e^{ikR}$ as well. 
The total wave at $P$ (which we denote with $\psi$) is thus the integral over the surface along d$f$: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:int1}
    \psi_P \propto \int \frac{g(f) e^{ikR(f)}}{R(f)}\del f.
\end{equation}
The approximation which can be successful applied is fairly simply: For $P$ far enough away, the distance
$R$ is nearly the same for all points on the surface $f$, such that $R$ is not dependent on $f$ anymore and
we can pull it out of the integral, yielding
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:int1}
    \psi_P \propto \int u(f) e^{ikR}\del f.
\end{equation}
The deeper point of this assumption is that for distance $R \Rightarrow \infty$ the wavefunction
of an arbitrarily shaped aperture is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture.
Let's assume an aperture function $g(x)$ of an one dimensional opening -- the dimension can be reduced 
due to translational symmetry. Then this translates into
\begin{equation}
    \psi_P \propto \mathcal{F} \left[g(k)\right ]_P
\end{equation}
where the dependency of $P$ in $g(x)$ comes from the factor $R$.
We have to think about Fourier transformations to continue our studies.

\subsubsection{Fourier Transformations}
We used the notation  $\mathcal{F} \left[g(k)\right ]_P$ for the Fourier transform 
of $g(k)$ which will be introduced here:
\begin{align}
f(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(k)\exp(i kx)\del k\\
F(k) &= \mathcal{F}_x\left [f(x)\right ](k) =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(k)\exp(-i kx) \del x
\end{align}
The most important properties are:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:fourier}
&\mathcal{F}\left [a f(x) + b g(x)\right ]
    = a F(k) + b G(k) 
    &\mbox{ (Linearity) }\\
&\mathcal{F}\left [f(x) * g(x)\right ](k)
    = \mathcal{F}\left [f(x)\right ]\mathcal{F}\left [g(x)\right ]
    \! &\mbox{ (Convolution) }\\
&\mathcal{F}_k\left [\left | F(k) \right |^2\right ](x)
   =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\bar{f}(\tau)f(\tau + x) \del\tau 
   &\mbox{ (Wiener-Khinchin Theorem) }
\end{align}
where in the last property $\bar{f}$ means the complex conjugation of $f$.

\subsubsection{Intensity distributions}
An important insight from electrodynamics is that the intensity density I of a
wave is proportional to the squared modulus of the complex wavefunction. We get the total intensity by
integrating over all points $P$.
This is enough for us to know to arrive at
\begin{equation}
    I_P \propto \psi_P^2 \propto \left ( \mathcal{F} \left[g(k)\right ]_P \right )^2 
\end{equation}
Now we can parametrize the point $P$ in various scenarios. Let's assume a screen on the right side of
figure~\ref{fig:beam} at an angle $\theta$. The distance $R$ can be parametrized such that
$R = x \sin \theta $, where $x$ is the horizontal distance (see figure~\ref{fig:beam}).
It is now possible to calculate the intensity from various one-dimensional aperture
functions, for example a single window:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:g1}
    g(x) &= 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } |x| \leq b/2 \\ 
        0 & \text{other }
    \end{cases} \\
    \Rightarrow \psi(\theta) \propto
    \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \exp ^{-i k x \sin(\theta)} \del x
    &= \frac{2\sin ( k \frac{b}{2} \sin ( \theta ))}{k \sin(\theta)} \propto
    \frac{\sin ( k \frac{b}{2} \sin ( \theta ))}{k \frac{b}{2}  \sin(\theta)} 
    = \sinc(\beta(\theta)).
\end{align}
We defined $\beta(\theta) = \frac{kb \sin(\theta)}{2}$.
For the intensity, we get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sinc1}
    I(\theta) \propto \psi^2 \propto \sinc^2(\beta(\theta)).
\end{equation}
For exemplary values, this is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:sinc1}).
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/sinc1}
    \caption{This is the theoretic intensity distribution following equation~\eqref{eq:sinc1}. 
        We plugged in $\lambda = 632.8$nm and $b = 1 \mu$m. The density is normed to one.}
    \label{fig:sinc1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Diffraction gratings}
Equation~\eqref{eq:sinc1} leads straightforward to the intensity density of
the diffraction grating, using \eqref{eq:fourier}. We need to understand 
that a diffraction grating is the result of convolution of a simple opening
(using the $\Theta$ function which is one for $x>0$ and zero otherwise)
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:multisplit}
    g_b(x) &= \Theta(x - \frac{b}{2}) - \Theta( \frac{b}{2} - x ) \qquad
           &\text{Single split} \\ 
   g(x)   &:= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} g_b(x-nK) 
         \qquad &\text{Multi split with spacing } K
\end{align}
Calculating straightforward we would have:
\begin{equation}
    \psi(\theta) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1}  \int^{n \cdot K + b}_{n \cdot K} e^{i k x sin(\theta)} \del x
\end{equation}
which simplifies (after some none trivial steps):
\begin{equation}
    I(\theta) \propto \psi(\theta)^2 \propto \sinc(\beta)^2 \left (\frac{\sin(N\gamma)}{N \sin(\gamma)}\right )^2
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \beta = \frac{k}{2}b \sin(\theta) \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma = k\cdot K \sin(\theta).
\end{equation}
$K \sin (\theta)$ is the difference in path length for the two corresponding light beams, 
starting at the two points of distance $K$. Every time
this distance is equal to a multiple of the wavelength, we will have a maximum:
\begin{equation}
    m \lambda = K \sin(\theta) \quad \text{ with }m \in \mathbb{Z}
    \label{eq:N_lines_interference}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Approximation to aperture function}
The relationship between intensity and aperture function can also be applied in the 
opposite direction. Any periodic function $f(x)$ may be written as a Fourier series. 
Choosing the orthogonal functions $\sin$ and $\cos$ as a basis, one obtains 
\begin{equation}
    f(t)=\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{k}\cos\left(kt\right)+b_{k}\sin\left(kt\right)\right)
    \label{eq:fourier_series}
\end{equation}
with real coefficients $a_k$ and $b_k$. For even functions $f$ with $f(x) = f(-x)$ 
this is further reduced to only even components, thus only the $\cos$ components:
\begin{equation}
    f(t)=\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\cos\left(kt\right)\, .
    \label{eq:fourier_series_even}
\end{equation}za
Taking the observed maxima of intensity $I_m$ of order $m$, we can 
apply this correspondance to approximate the aperture function $g(x)$ 
to the maximal order $m_\mathrm{max}$ observed:
\begin{equation}
    g(x)=\frac{\sqrt{I_{0}}}{2}+\sum_{m=1}^{m_\mathrm{max}} \sqrt{I_m}\cos\left(2 \pi m \frac{x}{K}\right)\, .
    \label{eq:g_approx}
\end{equation}
We can further normalize $g(x)$ by dividing through the sum of the coefficients:
\begin{equation}
    g_\mathrm{normalized}(x)=\frac{g(x)}{\sum_{m=0}^{m_\mathrm{max}} \sqrt{I_m}}\, .
    \label{eq:g_approx}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Resolution}
\label{sec:resolution}
Finally we define the resolution
\begin{equation}
    a = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}
\end{equation}
introducing $\Delta \lambda$, the minimal optical wavelength where separated maxima 
are observed. One can deduce the relationship
\begin{equation}
    a = N \cdot m_\mathrm{max}
    \label{eq:resolution}
\end{equation}
with the number of illuminated splits of the grating $N$ and the number of 
visible maxima on the screen $m_\mathrm{max}$.\cite{ver}

\subsection{Acousto-optics}
\begin{SCfigure}
    \centering
    \caption{Illustration of the acousto-optic effect: The former transparent and homogeneous medium is
        excited by an acoustic wave (turquoise) which changes the dielectric constant. On the top you notice
        the blue line which indicates an incident beam by an angle $\theta$. 
        This change of the refractive index is due to the dielectric constant is connected 
        to diffractive phenomena like gratings, but in a non-trivial way. 
        The main point here is that the angle $\theta$ should be small enough
        for the beam not to be scattered (this would lead to Bragg-like scattering which is at the moment
            not interesting for us). }
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/ramannath1.png}
    \label{fig:ramannath1}
\end{SCfigure}
Considering a density variation in a material due to an acoustic wave, the dielectric constant is will
change respectively (following \cite{boyd2003nonlinear} closely). 
Incident optical waves are diffracted or scattered, depending on the spatial curvature
of the dielectric constant (see figure~\ref{fig:ramannath1}). The condition for scattering not to occur can
be estimated: Using the acoustic wavelength $\Lambda$ and the optic wavelength $\lambda$ we introduce 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:deltatheta}
    \delta \theta = \frac{\lambda}{\Lambda}
\end{equation}
as the characteristic angular spread of the diffracted light. Scattering cannot occur, when 
\begin{equation}
    \delta \theta L < \Lambda.
\end{equation}
Combining the two equations, we get
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\lambda L}{\Lambda^2} < 1 \, .
\end{equation}
We chose the density fluctuations to be 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \tilde{n}(z,t) = 2 \Delta n \sin(q z - \Omega t) \, ,
\end{equation}
where the tilde refers to time dependency and $\Delta n$ denotes the time independent part.
$\Omega$ denotes the frequency and $q$ the spatial wave vector of the acoustic wave.
The incident light can now be represented by 
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{E}(r,t) = A e ^{i(kx - \omega t)} + A^{*}e ^{-i(kx - \omega t)}.
\end{equation}
which is a solution of unbounded Laplace equation. 
Passing through the interacting region $L$ the optical wave picks up a phase 
\begin{equation}
    \phi = \Delta \tilde{n}\frac{\omega}{c}L = \Delta n \frac{\omega}{c}L \sin (qz - \Omega t).
\end{equation}
The final and critical step is to use the \textbf{Jacobi-Anger expansion}
\begin{equation}
    e^{i\delta \sin y} = \sum_{l = -\infty}^{\infty} J_l(\delta)e^{ily} 
\end{equation}
where the $J_l$ are the Bessel functions of first kind, defined by
\begin{equation}
J_\alpha(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m+\alpha+1)} {\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}^{2m+\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Plugging in the last two equations we can look at the electromagnetic wave after surpassing the 
cell of length $L$:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{E}(r,t)=A \sum_{l = -\infty}^{\infty} J_l(\delta)e^{i
        \left [kx -\omega t + \delta \sin(qz - \Omega t) \right ]  } + \quad \text{complex conjugates}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \delta = 2\Delta n \omega L / c.
\end{equation}
Analogue to the diffraction grating, the maxima of this patters 
are observed at angles
\begin{equation}
    \sin(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{\Lambda} m \qquad m \in \mathbb{Z} \, .
\end{equation}
And the intensity peaks are given by
\begin{equation}
    I_l = |A|^2 J_l(\delta)^2
\end{equation}
For sound waves in fluids, the refractive index changes for small changes in density $\delta \rho$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta n }{n - 1} = \frac{\delta \rho}{\rho_0}
\end{equation}
with density $\rho$ and refractive index $n$ of the unpertubed medium. Since the intensity of the sound 
wave $S$ for the piezoelectric actuator with applied voltage $U$ goes with $S \propto U^2$ and further 
$S \propto (\rho / \rho_0)$~\cite{ver}, we get the relationship 
\begin{equation}
    I_l = |A|^2 J_l(\delta)^2
\end{equation}
for the intensity of the $l$th maximum.
