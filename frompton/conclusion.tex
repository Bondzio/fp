\section{Conclusion}

In \ref{sss:calib} we did an energy calibration for both scintillators. Our
results are
\begin{align}
  E_{\mathrm{NaI}}(C) = \pyexp{calib_naj_a} + \pyexp{calib_naj_b} \cdot C.
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
  E_{\mathrm{PVC}}(C) = \pyexp{calib_pvc_a} + \pyexp{calib_pvc_b} \cdot C.
\end{align}

Our first task was to verify the conservation of energy for \compton
scattering. Figure \ref{fig:conserv} shows that we could verify the
conservation of energy in our experiment. The energy of the scattered photon
can therefore be calculated with
\begin{align}
  E'_\gamma = \frac{E_\gamma}{1 - \frac{E_\gamma}{m_e} (1-\cos \theta)}
\end{align}
where $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the primary photon.

Our last task was to calculate the differential cross section and compare it
to the \kleinn{} formula. Figure \ref{fig:cross} shows the result. We did
show that the differential cross section is in the correct order of
magnitude, but due to the larger standard deviations we can neither verify
nor disproof the \kleinn{} formula.
