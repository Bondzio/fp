\section{Introduction}

Until 1922, when \person{Arthur Compton} discovered the so called
\person{Compton} effect, the photo electrical effect was the only proof of the wave
particle dualism
which \person{Albert Einstein} had postulated in 1905. \person{Compton}
discovered the characteristic scattering angle distribution and then
realized that the scattered
light had less energy depending on the scattering angle. He showed that his
phenomena can be explained by an elastic scattering of electron and photon.


\vspace{1em}\noindent In our experiment we want to
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(A)] verify the conservation of energy and
  \item[(B)] measure the differential cross section of \compton scattering.
\end{enumerate}
