\section{Theoretical backgrounds}
\label{sec:theory}
\subsection{Nuclear spin}
\paragraph{Assuming a particle}
described by its wavefunction $\Psi$, we can describe 
its fundamental properties by quantum numbers corresponding to eigenstates
of different operators. Aside from the quantum number $n$ corresponding to the 
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and thus to the energy level, particles can be further characterized 
by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ and the spin quantum number 
$s$ as well as the projections of both of them onto the $z$-axis, given by 
$m_l$ and $m_s$, respectively. For the nucleus with wavefunction $\Psi_N$, 
spin and angular momentum are coupled to the 
nuclear spin with corresponding operator $\hat{I}$. Its properties are given by:
\begin{align}
    \hat{\mathbf{I}} \Psi_N &= \mathbf{I} \Psi_N \\ 
\intertext{for which}
    \mathbf{I}^2 &= \hbar^2 I(I + 1)
    \label{eq:I_abs}\\
    \left[\hat{H}, \hat{I}^2\right]_- &= 0 
    \label{eq:I_H}\\
\end{align}
While \eqref{eq:I_abs} specifies the absolute value of $\mathbf{I}$, the commutator relation 
\eqref{eq:I_H} ensures that $I$ is constant in time und thus a 'good quantum number'.
For the quantum number of nuclear spin we have $I \in {0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \ldots}$, while $\hbar$ is the 
reduced Planck constant. A second constant quantum number corresponding to the nuclear spin can be defined:
the projection on the $z$-axis, which in the experiment is given by the direction of the external $B$-field.
It is given by
\begin{align}
    I_z &= m_I \hbar \\
    m_I &\in \left\{-I, -I + 1, \ldots, I - 1, I\right\}
\end{align}
Thus we have $2I + 1$ values for $m_I$, which due to its determining role in the Zeeman effect is 
also called \emph{magnetic quantum number}. Depending on whether $I$ is integer or half integer
we have to apply Bose- or Fermi-statistics; the particles are called bosons or fermions 
accordingly~\cite{dem}.

\subsection{Magnetic moment}
\paragraph{Connected to the}
nuclear spin we observe the \emph{nuclear magnetic moment}
\begin{equation}
    \mu_N = \gamma_N \mathbf{I},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_N$ is the \emph{gyromagnetic ratio} for the nucleus, which 
can be written in terms of the \emph{nuclear magneton} $\mu_K$
as
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_N = \frac{g_N \mu_K}{\hbar} \, .
    \label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
The dimensionless \emph{nuclear g-factor} $g_N$ depends on the constituents of the 
nucleus and is a quantity experimentally measured. $\mu_K$ is defined 
analogously to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B$, but for protons, such that 
\begin{equation}
    \mu_K := \frac{\hbar e}{2 m_p} = 5.05079\mathrm{e}-27 \, \mathrm{\frac{J}{T}}\, .
\end{equation}
with elementary charge $e = 1.602\mathrm{e}-19$ A s 
and proton mass $m_p = 1.673\mathrm{e}-27$~kg~\cite{dem}.
As ferminons, protons and neutrons follow the Pauli principle of exclusion. 
Having spin $S_N = \frac{1}{2}$, there are two possible 'orientations' for 
the $z$-component, namely $m_{s_N} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$. Thus, one orbital 
is filled with two particles of opposite spin. A nucleus can then be 
characterized by the number of protons and neutrons each being 
even ('g') or odd ('u'). A 'gg' nucleus thus has total nuclear spin $I = 0$, 
as for example the case for ($_8^{16}$O)- and ($_6^{12}$C)-atoms. 
'gu' and 'ug' nuclei have $I = \frac{1}{2}$, like the 'ug' proton ($^1$H) 
measured in this experiment as the only non-zero spin component both of 
glycol (C$_2$H$_6$O$_2$) and water (H$_2$O). The other probe under consideration, 
the $_9^{19}$F with 9 protons and 10 neutrons, 
also has a 'ug' nucleus and thus $I = \frac{1}{2}$, but a different nuclear g-factor. 
Nuclei with odd numbers of 
protons and neutrons have spin $I = 1$; they are aligned parallel due to a lower 
energy stemming from the quark structure of the nucleons respect to the anti-parallel 
alignment with zero nuclear spin. An example is the deuterium $^2$H. However, in this 
experiment we will not look at this case.\cite{ver}

\subsection{Nuclear magnetic resonance}
\paragraph{The energy of a}
magnetic dipole $\mu$ in an external field $\B$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
    E = - \mu_N \cdot \B
\end{equation}
in both the classical and the quantum mechanical case. In the latter, 
we take the projection of $\mu$ onto the direction of $\B$ with magnitude 
$B := |\B|$ and thus obtain 
\begin{equation}
    E = - g_N \mu_K m_I B \, .
\end{equation}
An energy level which prior to switching on the magnetic field is degenerate in $m_I$ 
will thus be subject to the \emph{Zeeman effect}, describing the split up into two 
distinct levels with difference in energy $\Delta E$. Since $\Delta m_I = 1$, the 
distance between the two levels is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E = - g_N \mu_K B \, .
\end{equation}
In order to 'flip spins', i.~e. to change state from $m_I = - \frac{1}{2}$ to $m_I = + \frac{1}{2}$, 
or vice versa, the energy has to be absorped or released. The selection rule $\Delta I = 0, \, \Delta m_I= \pm1$ 
forbids spontaneous transitions without emission or absorption and further corresponds to \emph{magnetic dipole} 
radiation.~\cite{mel} The source, an oscillating $\B$-field, has to have a frequency $\nu$ correspoding to $\Delta E$ by
\begin{equation}
    \nu = \frac{\Delta E}{h} = \frac{g_N \mu_K B}{h} = \frac{\gamma_N B}{2 \pi}\, .
    \label{eq:nu}
\end{equation}
The frequency band is widened by the typical effects, such as natural width, Doppler effect 
and collisions. 
\paragraph{In order to examine}
the effect of a probe on the energy of an external field, there are several
aspects to look at. At first glance, one might come to the conclusion, that the effects of 
absorping photons of the field and those photons being added to the field cancel each other. 
This is not the case though, because of the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        The spontaneous emission is distributed isotropically, such that these photons are lost for 
        the external field along one axis. Furthermore, spontaneous emission is observed very rarely. 
    \item
        The number of atoms in the two states is not equal, since the states are distributed according to 
        a Boltzmann distribution, namely $n_{m_I} \propto \exp\left\{-\frac{E_{m_I}}{kT}\right\}$. 
        Thus we can write the ratio of the two occupation numbers by
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{n_{+1/2}}{n_{-1/2}} 
                = \exp\left\{-\frac{E_{+1/2} - E_{-1/2}}{kT} \right\}
                = \exp\left\{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT} \right\} \, .
        \end{equation}
        We conclude that the number of states with $m_I = -\frac{1}{2}$ is higher than the energetically 
        higher state with $m_I = +\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, more photons are absorped than emitted. 
\end{itemize}
One would now expect this latter effect to cease after some time, as $n_{+1/2}$ raises at the expense of 
$n_{-1/2}$. However, the spins can flip down via a different mechanism as well:
The spin-lattice relaxation allows $\Delta E$ to be passed 
over to the lattice without radiation, such that the energy is lost to the field. This happens with a 
typical \emph{lattice relaxation time} $T_l$. If the number of excess nuclei $n_0$ is decreased 
exponentially at rate $R$, 
\begin{equation}
    n_0(t) = N_0 \exp\left\{-R t \right\}, 
\end{equation}
with initial number $N_0$, then for $R \ll 1 / T_l$, $n_0 \rightarrow N_0$ for $t \rightarrow \infty$, 
whereas in the opposite case $R \gg 1 / T_l$, $n_0 \rightarrow 0$ for $t \rightarrow \infty$, since 
the rate of relaxation is characterized by $1 / T_l$. A simple conclusion is, that 
the induced power of the high frequency $\B$-field should not be too high.~\cite{mel}

Yet another effect is the spin-spin interaction which changes the external $\B$-field of atoms close 
to a flipped spin slightly with respect to the case without flip. This results in widening of the 
absorption line. 

\paragraph{Todays applications in}
analytical chemestry use the fine structure of the absorption lines. For much more homogeneous 
external fields applied, one can measure this fine structure which depends on the organic compound 
to which the corresponding atoms belong. Due to their high gyromagnetic ratio, both protons and 
$^{19}$F atoms are used in this kind of anaylsis. 

\subsection{Hall effect and sensor}
\paragraph{If we look at a}
conductor with an applied current located inside of an magnetic field
(see figure~\ref{fig:halleffect}), the Lorentz force
\begin{equation}
    F = q ( E + v \times B)
\end{equation}
acts on the moving charges such that perpendicular to the direction of the current we will have a potential
compensating the Lorentz force:
\begin{equation}
    e E_H = -e v \times B
\end{equation}
By integrating over the distance $b$ of the conducter and supposing a linear
relationship, we arrive at
\begin{equation}
    U_H = - b v B \, .
\end{equation}
This can be expressed in terms of the current $I = d \cdot c \cdot j$ where $d$ is the width of the 
conducter and $j=e n v$ the current density:
\begin{equation}
    U_H = \frac{- I\cdot B}{e\cdot n\cdot d}  = -A_H \frac{I\cdot B}{d} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we introduced the Hall-coefficient $A_H =\frac{1}{e\cdot n}$ of the material. 
For know material constants, the relationship can be used in \emph{Hall effect sensors}, 
a device also used in this experiment for measurung the strength of the applied magnetic field. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/halleffect}
    \caption{This is the conducter we are talking about in the introduction \cite{gerthsen} to the hall effect.
    The lorentz force is driving the charges perpendicular to the magnetic field until the potential is 
    high enough for the charges to saturate.}
    \label{fig:halleffect}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lock-in method}
\paragraph{In order to supress}
noise and frequencies from other processes, we use
a frequently used method called ``lock-in amplification''. Depending on the
setup it is possible to reduce the noise by a factor $10^6$. The method
is based on the orthogonality relation of sinusoidal functions (which
can be seen easily differentiating the left with respect to $x$):
\begin{equation}
    \int \sin(a x) \sin(b x) dx =\frac{ b \sin(a x) \cos(b x)-a \cos(a x)
            \sin(b x)}{a^2-b^2}
\end{equation}
If we let the integration go from $\infty$ to $-\infty$ we end up with:
\begin{equation}
    (a,b) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sin(a x) \sin(b x) dx = \delta(a - b)
\end{equation}
Which stems from the sinusoidal functions forming a complete basis with
the integral as inner product.
Since we cannot use the integral over the entire real line, we have to rely
on shorter times: 
\begin{equation}
    (a,b)_t := \int_{0}^{t} \sin(a x) \sin(b x) dx = \delta(a - b)
\end{equation}
\paragraph{case 1: $t = 2k\pi /a$:}
\begin{equation}
    (a,b)_{2\pi /a} = \frac{a \sin(2\pi k\frac{a}{b})}{b^2 - a^2}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{case 1: $t = 2k\pi /b$:}
\begin{equation}
    (a,b)_{2\pi /b} = \frac{b \sin(2\pi k\frac{a}{b})}{a^2 - b^2}
\end{equation}
We notice we can distinguish whether the frequencies are equal or not 
since there is a singularity, but with restrictions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The integral is evaluated continuosly, which is not possible
        in the real case, so the singularity is replaced by peak, which
        has a finite width.
\item As we do not integrate over the whole real line, we see in the two
    cases that higher harmonics (when working with nonlinear phenomena)
    can appear as well, which should be taken into account.
\item The strength which discriminates the $a=b$ from the $a\neq b$ case
    (the effective bandwidth)
    depends on the amplitude of the reference signal. 
\end{itemize}

Now we can 
use in such a way that we take the input signal, multiply it by a
reference signal and integrate the result over a given time.
We chose the reference signal with a frequency in the range where we
expect our signal frequency to be: \\\\

    \textbf{Phase difference} & \textbf{Recieved Signal} \\
    \hline
    $0^\circ$ & maximal\\
    $180^{\circ}$ & minimal \\
    $90^\circ$ or $270^\circ$ & 0 
\end{tabular}
