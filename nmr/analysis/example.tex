		Example for failure of the lock-in method.
		The upper two graphs show the sine modulated saw tooth signal
		in two different ranges for $t$. The zoomed range of the uppermost 
		graph can be used to calculate the frequency of the sine modulation.
		The output signal is basically noise, no absorption signal can be observed.
