\section{Evaluation for Pockels effects}
In this section, we calculate the electro-optic coefficient 
by two methods, using the result of the theoretical part, given by
\begin{equation}
    r_{41} = \frac{\lambda d}{4 l U_{\lambda / 2}} 
    \left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{\eps_\perp} + \frac{1}{\eps_\parallel}\right)\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\, .
    \label{eq:r_41_U}
\end{equation}

If we take the values given in section \ref{tab:pockels_technical}, 
and estimate the uncertainties, we get the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item[] $\lambda = (632.8\pm 0.1)$nm
\item[] $n_1     = 1.522\pm 0.001$
\item[] $n_3     = 1.477\pm 0.001$
\item[] $l       = ( 20\pm 0.1)$mm
\item[] $d       = (2.4\pm 0.1)$mm
\end{itemize}

The two different methods are now exercised below.
All propagation of errors is calculated using the python package 
'uncertainties'~\cite{uc}.


\subsection{Saw tooth method}
Now we calculated the maxima of the signal originating from the applied saw tooth input

26.1 \pm 5.5
(2.1+/-0.4)
27.1 \pm 5.7
mean: (2.63+/-0.25)

   
\end{aligned}
\subsection{DC current method}
\label{ssub:DC current method}
As seen in the measurements section, the frequency doubling can be 
observed best for a frequency of the input sine signal with 
$0.5 kHz$. For the corresponding data sets, we use Fourier analysis 
described in~\ref{sec:pdf} to determine 
the input voltage $U_\mathrm{DC}$ at which frequency doubling occurs. 
To illustrate the procedure, we show an example at $U_\mathrm{DC} = 137.0$ V.
The cut-off is taken at $t = 1.1$ ms and $t = 9.05$ ms, as shown in figure 
\ref{fig:cut_off_example}. The result of the FFT is then shown in figure 
\ref{fig:fft_example} for a larger range of frequencies and those of interest, 
namly $\nu < 2$ kHz. One clearly observes the two peaks close to 
0.5 kHz and 1.0 kHz, being of the same scale. This procedure is 
done with all datasets corresponding to the signals shown in 
the figures \ref{fig:sinus8}, which has shown the largest 
change regarding frequency doubling by eye. The result of the fourier 
analysis in the range from $0$ to $2$ kHz as well as the 
value of $|\mathrm{FFT}\left[U_\mathrm{out} \left(\nu\right)\right]|^2$ for 
$\nu_1 = 0.45$ kHz and $\nu_2 = 0.91$ kHz 
is shown in figure \ref{fig:fft_all}.
One can clearly observe the drop in amplitude for $U_\mathrm{DC} = 139.0$ kHz. 
We will thus take this to be our measured value for $\Ula$.
\begin{figure}

    $U_\mathrm{DC} = 137.0$ V. The minima of the input 
    signal $U_\mathrm{in}$, which is shown rescaled in this plos, 
    are found numerically in the ranges 
    $t \in (1.0, 1.5)$ ms and $t \in (8.5, 9.5)$ ms. 
    Further window functions are not applied. 
    By eye, the frequency doubling is seen already. 
    }
\label{fig:cut_off_example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\caption{
    Example for results of fourier analysis, for measured data at 
    $U_\mathrm{DC} = 137.0$ V.
    On the larger range, one observes strong peaks for low frequencies 
    and one relatively high peak at $\nu = 35.0$ kHz, which will not be 
    subject to further analysis. On the reduced range, the two peaks 
    due to the input signal and frequency doubling can be observed. 
    }
\label{fig:fft_example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fft_all.pdf}
\caption{
    Taken the quantity
    $|\mathrm{FFT}\left[U_\mathrm{out} \left(\nu\right)\right]|^2$ 
    for all datasets yields a fairly confusing image, 
    which is, however, instructive as one observes the 
    frequency doubling for the different direct currents 
    $U_\mathrm{DC}$.
    In the right plot, the minimum for the lower frequency indicates 
    the maximal frequency doubling. We expected a maximum in the 
    double frequency, which clearly doesn't show. This 
    may be due to the small size of the dataset (in terms 
        of $t$ or the number of oscillations). 
    }
\label{fig:fft_all}
\end{figure}

The value of $\Ula$ for the given input signal is thus 
found with $\Ula = (135  \pm 15)$. 
The estimated the uncertainty on $\Ula$ based on the 
observation, that $\Ula$ appeared to be 
depending on the frequency. This phenomenon is not 
explained in the formalism used in the theoretical sections. 
Further, we expect quite large uncertainties due to 
electronic noise and offsets. 

Using the parameters given above, we get the following result: 
\begin{equation*}
r_{41} = \left (41.7 \pm 2.3 \right )  \mathrm{pm}
\end{equation*}

Clearly, this result is not anywhere close to the value given in 
literature with $r = 23.4$ pm at room temperature. There are 
various possibilities regarding the origin of this disagreement. 
First, we name the uncertainies in the setup and electronics. 
Secondly, we suspect a wrongly setup of the polarization filters, 
which might may not have been aligned properly with an 
angle of $45\Deg$. Thirdly, we observed the strong frequency dependance of 
the point of frequency doubling, which leads to the assumption, that 
the theoretical calculations are missing an important factor. 
It is not clear, to which extend natural birefraction or 
secondary electro-optical effects can be neglected, although 
we would suspect these errors to be much smaller than the ones 
induced by the electronics.
