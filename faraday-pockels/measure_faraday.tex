\section{Measurements for Faraday effect}
\subsection{Inspection of the experiment}
\subsubsection{Observations}
The very first measurement with $I=0.0A$ yields as expected a rotation of the polarization
with $\alpha = 0.6 \pm 0.2$. We will choose the reference state of half-shade Polarimeter 
to be clearly dark, since the precision is best in this case.
