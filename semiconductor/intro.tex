\section{Introduction}
The modern age of crystal electronics is based up materials which are neither
metals nor insulators; such materials are called semiconductors, and their electrical properties are
intermediate between those of metals and insulators. This is because of a rather special arrangement of
energy levels of electrons in semiconductors \cite{phillips2012bonds}.
