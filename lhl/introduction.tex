\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\paragraph{Decay of Particles} is one of the most fundamental phenomenon
in physics and within this experiment we will have to chance
to get an hands-on introduction into the fascinating field of nuclear and radiochemistry. \\\\ 
The goal will be to find the half-lifes of two elements: \textbf{Samarium-147}, as an \textit{alpha ray}
source and \textbf{potassium-40} as \textit{beta ray} source. Firstly, in section~\ref{sec:theory}, 
we offer a short overview about the most important theoretical concepts we will be using.
In section~\ref{sec:setup} we will talk about the experimental setup and its 
functionality and after, in section~\ref{sec:measurements}, about our
own conduction of the measurements and their evaluation. Finally
we will give an appopriate interpretation of our results and conclude with
section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. For additional figures and the scanned records,
refer to the appendix, section~\ref{sec:appendix}.
